**Created by [Talos](https://github.com/talos-agent)** - A revolutionary decentralized application that eliminates the stress of cryptocurrency payments by enabling **secure, cancellable transfers** and **invoice functionality**. Say goodbye to the anxiety of sending crypto to wrong addresses or waiting for payment confirmations!

> **The Problem**: Traditional crypto payments are irreversible and stressful - one wrong address and your funds are gone forever.
> 
> **The Solution**: Aegis Transfer requires recipient acceptance and allows cancellation, making crypto payments as safe as traditional banking.

## Key Features

### **Secure Cancellable Transfers**
- Send funds that can be **cancelled if not claimed** within a timeframe
- **Eliminate address errors** - if recipient doesn't claim, you get your money back
- **Time-based expiry** - transfers automatically become cancellable after set duration
- **Optional claim codes** for additional security on sensitive transfers

### **Invoice System** 
- **Request payments** from specific addresses with detailed descriptions
- **Professional invoicing** for freelancers, businesses, and service providers
- **Automatic payment tracking** and status management
- **Expiry dates** for invoice validity

### **Complete Transfer Management**
- **Dashboard view** of all pending incoming and outgoing transfers
- **Real-time status** tracking (pending, claimed, cancelled, expired)
- **Multi-token support** - ETH and ERC20 tokens
- **Gas-optimized** smart contracts built with Foundry

## How It Works

### For Senders (Much Less Stress!)

1. **Create Transfer**: Send funds to a recipient address with optional expiry time
2. **Add Security**: Optionally include a claim code for sensitive transfers  
3. **Stay in Control**: Cancel anytime if the transfer isn't claimed
4. **Peace of Mind**: No more worrying about wrong addresses!

```solidity
// Example: Send 1 ETH with 7-day expiry and claim code
createTransfer(
    recipientAddress,
    address(0),        // ETH
    0,                 // amount in msg.value
    7 days,            // expiry duration
    "secret123"        // optional claim code
)
```

### For Recipients (Simple & Secure!)

1. **Receive Notification**: Get notified of incoming transfers
2. **Review Details**: Check amount, sender, and any requirements
3. **Claim Funds**: Use claim code (if required) to receive funds
4. **Instant Settlement**: Funds transferred directly to your wallet

```solidity
// Claim transfer with code
claimTransfer(transferId, "secret123")
```

## Invoice System

Perfect for freelancers, businesses, and anyone who needs to request payments professionally!

### Creating Invoices

```solidity
// Request 0.5 ETH payment with 30-day expiry
createInvoice(
    payerAddress,
    address(0),                    // ETH
    500000000000000000,           // 0.5 ETH in wei
    30 days,                      // expiry
    "Web development services"     // description
)
```

### Paying Invoices

```solidity
// Pay invoice by ID
payInvoice(invoiceId) // with ETH value
```

### Use Cases
- **Freelance Work**: Request payment for completed projects
- **Business Services**: Professional invoicing with crypto payments  
- **Recurring Payments**: Set up regular payment requests
- **Escrow Alternative**: Secure payment requests with expiry dates

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Foundry + Solidity)
- **SafeTransfer.sol**: Core contract implementing cancellable transfers and invoices
- **ISafeTransfer.sol**: Interface defining contract functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with edge case coverage
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient storage patterns and minimal gas usage

### Frontend (Next.js + React)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface for all transfer operations
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless wallet connection and transaction handling
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status tracking and notifications
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Foundry toolkit

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talos-agent/aegis-transfer.git
cd aegis-transfer
```

2. **Set up Smart Contracts**
