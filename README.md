**Created by [Talos](https://github.com/talos-agent)** - A revolutionary decentralized application that eliminates the stress of cryptocurrency payments by enabling **secure, cancellable transfers** and **invoice functionality**. Say goodbye to the anxiety of sending crypto to wrong addresses or waiting for payment confirmations!

> 🎯 **The Problem**: Traditional crypto payments are irreversible and stressful - one wrong address and your funds are gone forever.
> 
> ✅ **The Solution**: Aegis Transfer requires recipient acceptance and allows cancellation, making crypto payments as safe as traditional banking.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 **Secure Cancellable Transfers**
- Send funds that can be **cancelled if not claimed** within a timeframe
- **Eliminate address errors** - if recipient doesn't claim, you get your money back
- **Time-based expiry** - transfers automatically become cancellable after set duration
- **Optional claim codes** for additional security on sensitive transfers

### 📄 **Invoice System** 
- **Request payments** from specific addresses with detailed descriptions
- **Professional invoicing** for freelancers, businesses, and service providers
- **Automatic payment tracking** and status management
- **Expiry dates** for invoice validity

### 🎛️ **Complete Transfer Management**
- **Dashboard view** of all pending incoming and outgoing transfers
- **Real-time status** tracking (pending, claimed, cancelled, expired)
- **Multi-token support** - ETH and ERC20 tokens
- **Gas-optimized** smart contracts built with Foundry

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Senders (Much Less Stress! 😌)

1. **Create Transfer**: Send funds to a recipient address with optional expiry time
2. **Add Security**: Optionally include a claim code for sensitive transfers  
3. **Stay in Control**: Cancel anytime if the transfer isn't claimed
4. **Peace of Mind**: No more worrying about wrong addresses!

```solidity
// Example: Send 1 ETH with 7-day expiry and claim code
createTransfer(
    recipientAddress,
    address(0),        // ETH
    0,                 // amount in msg.value
    7 days,            // expiry duration
    "secret123"        // optional claim code
)
```

### For Recipients (Simple & Secure! 🔐)

1. **Receive Notification**: Get notified of incoming transfers
2. **Review Details**: Check amount, sender, and any requirements
3. **Claim Funds**: Use claim code (if required) to receive funds
4. **Instant Settlement**: Funds transferred directly to your wallet

```solidity
// Claim transfer with code
claimTransfer(transferId, "secret123")
```

## 💰 Invoice System

Perfect for freelancers, businesses, and anyone who needs to request payments professionally!

### Creating Invoices

```solidity
// Request 0.5 ETH payment with 30-day expiry
createInvoice(
    payerAddress,
    address(0),                    // ETH
    500000000000000000,           // 0.5 ETH in wei
    30 days,                      // expiry
    "Web development services"     // description
)
```

### Paying Invoices

```solidity
// Pay invoice by ID
payInvoice(invoiceId) // with ETH value
```

### Use Cases
- **Freelance Work**: Request payment for completed projects
- **Business Services**: Professional invoicing with crypto payments  
- **Recurring Payments**: Set up regular payment requests
- **Escrow Alternative**: Secure payment requests with expiry dates
